      { "q": "How do I log in to the shopkeeper dashboard?", "a": "1. Go to the login page → 2. Enter your <strong>personal email</strong> → 3. Enter your <strong>password</strong> → 4. Solve the <strong>CAPTCHA</strong> (first login or new device) → 5. Click <strong>Sign In</strong>." },
      { "q": "I forgot my password – what should I do?", "a": "Click <strong>Forgot Password?</strong> on the login screen. A reset link will be sent to your <strong>personal email</strong>. Check spam/junk if you don’t see it." },
      { "q": "Why can’t I log in with my company email?", "a": "Login uses your <strong>personal email only</strong> (the one you registered with). Company email is used for subscription & verification, but <strong>not</strong> for logging in." },
      { "q": "Do I need CAPTCHA every time I log in?", "a": "No — only on <strong>first login</strong>, <strong>new device</strong>, or <strong>unusual activity</strong>. After that, you can enable 2FA for faster, secure access." },
      { "q": "Can I log in from multiple devices?", "a": "Yes! Use your <strong>personal email + password</strong> on any device. Enable 2FA in settings for extra security on shared computers." },
      { "q": "Why do I need a subscription before creating an account?", "a": "Subscription verifies your business and unlocks premium tools. It prevents spam and ensures you get full support from day one." },
      { "q": "Is the dashboard mobile-friendly?", "a": "Yes! Fully responsive — manage customers, launch campaigns, and view reports on phone, tablet, or desktop." },
      { "q": "How secure is my data?", "a": "We use bank-level AES-256 encryption, GDPR-compliant storage, and regular security audits. Your data is never shared." },
